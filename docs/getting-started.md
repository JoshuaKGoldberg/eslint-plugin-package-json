## 📖 Usage

### Recommended Config

This plugin's recommended configuration enables its rules on `**/package.json` files, parsing them with [`jsonc-eslint-parser`](https://github.com/ota-meshi/jsonc-eslint-parser).

```ts
// eslint.config.ts
import packageJson from "eslint-plugin-package-json";
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";

export default defineConfig([
	// your other ESLint configurations
	packageJson.configs.recommended,
]);
```

If you want to override the recommended rules:

```ts
// eslint.config.ts
import packageJson from "eslint-plugin-package-json";
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";

export default defineConfig([
	// your other ESLint configurations
	{
		extends: [packageJson.configs.recommended],
		files: ["package.json"],
		rules: {
			"package-json/require-author": "error",
		},
	},
]);
```

See [ESLint's _Configuration Files_ guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new) for details on how to customize your rules and other config settings.

### Recommended Config for Publishable Packages

> [!NOTE]
> This config was recently made redundant and is now the same as `recommended`.
> However, we're keeping it as its own config for now, in the event that we add new rules unique to the publishable use case.

The `recommended-publishable` configuration has everything in it from the standard `recommended` config, with some additional rules added that are geared towards packages that are intended to be published.

```ts
// eslint.config.ts
import packageJson from "eslint-plugin-package-json";
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";

export default defineConfig([
	// your other ESLint configurations
	packageJson.configs["recommended-publishable"],
]);
```

### Stylistic Config

The `stylistic` configuration sets up the parser and files similar to the recommended config, but includes rules that are more opinionated about the style of a package.json.
This can be used in addition to the recommended config, or on its own.

```ts
// eslint.config.ts
import packageJson from "eslint-plugin-package-json";
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";

export default defineConfig([
	// your other ESLint configurations
	packageJson.configs.recommended, // or packageJson.configs["recommended-publishable"]
	packageJson.configs.stylistic,
]);
```

### Settings

Some rules can be configured in ESLint shared settings.
You can set them in `settings.packageJson` in an ESLint flat config.

Example:

```ts
// eslint.config.ts
import packageJson from "eslint-plugin-package-json";
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: {
		"package-json": packageJson,
	},
	rules: {
		// `description` won't be required in package.json with `"private": true`
		"package-json/require-description": "error",
	},
	settings: {
		packageJson: {
			enforceForPrivate: false,
		},
	},
});
```

#### `enforceForPrivate`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** [see below]

When a package.json file has a `"private": true` field, it indicates that the package will not be published to npm (or another online registry).
Some fields that are nice to have in public packages become less relevant when a package is private.
This option determines whether `require-*` rules, if used, should enforce the presence of the corresponding property in package.json files that have `"private": true`.

By default, this is:

- `false` for [`require-name`](docs/rules/require-name.md) and [`require-version`](docs/rules/require-version.md).
- `true` for every other `require-*` rule.

By specifying this setting as `true` or `false`, it will override the defaults and apply the setting for ALL rules.
In that case, either all `require-*` rules will be applied to private packages or no `require-*` rules will be applied to private packages.
Even then, you can override the setting again at the rule level, by using the rule's `ignorePrivate` option, which will take precedence over this global setting.
