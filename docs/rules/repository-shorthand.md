# repository-shorthand

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: `legacy-recommended`, ✅ `recommended`.

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule enforces that `repository` entries in a `package.json` use either object _(default)_ or shorthand notation to refer to GitHub repositories when possible.

## Rule Details

npm previously allowed a "shorthand" form like `"JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json"` to specifying a full URL to a GitHub repository like `"https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json"`.
However, current versions of npm now normalize that form to the object longhand with `type` and `url` and warn against the shorthand.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the default options:

```json
{
	"repository": "JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json"
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the default options:

```json
{
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		"url": "https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json"
	}
}
```

### Options

```json
{
	"package-json/order-properties": [
		"error",
		{
			"form": "shorthand"
		}
	]
}
```

#### Form

The `form` property specifies whether to use:

- `"object"` _(default)_: an object with `"type"` and `"url"`
- `"shorthand"`: the shorthand string equivalent.

The `object` form is generally recommended as that's what `npm publish` prefers.

> If and when npm drops support for the `"shorthand"` form, this rule will likely remove its options.
