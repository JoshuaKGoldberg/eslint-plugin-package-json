When you have a dependency declared in a package's `peerDependencies`, it's meant to be an expression of compatibility with that dependency.
It also establishes a contract with consumers of your package that they should install a version of that dependency within the range that you've declared.
Since you also need to use that package locally as part of development, it's generally a best practice to declare it in the package's `devDependencies` as well, so that it's installed and available for use.

## Rule Details

This rule requires that all dependencies declared in a package's `peerDependencies` are also declared in the package's `devDependencies`.
